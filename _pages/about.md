I am a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Austin. 

I am currently working on ML/Data Science research advised by Dr. Shyamal Mitra. My work involves developing deep neural network architectures for the deconvolution of astronomical images. I am also an ML Engineer on the UT RAS IGVC team, where I create computer vision models for lane and obstacle detection, enabling a robot to navigate a complex obstacle course autonomously. Previously, I was involved in energy harvesting research at COEP alongside Dr. Padmakar Kelkar.

I'm deeply passionate about ML/Computer Vision and its applications in astronomy and robotics. 

Please explore my work above, and feel free to reach out! :)
