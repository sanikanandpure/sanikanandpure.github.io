I am a first-year Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Austin. 

I'm currently working on ML/Data Science research advised by Dr. Shyamal Mitra. My work involves classifying and understanding the distribution of galaxies and other cosmic bodies using machine learning, data science, and computational geometry. I am also an ML Engineer on the UT RAS IGVC team, where I create computer vision models for lane and obstacle detection to enable a robot to navigate a complex obstacle course autonomously. Previously, I was involved in energy harvesting research at COEP alongside Dr. Padmakar Kelkar and worked as a full-stack developer at a digital audio marketplace startup.

My hope is to contribute to the advancement of autonomous robotics. I envision a future where we have fully autonomous robots that revolutionize industries including healthcare, emergency response, and manufacturing. Please explore my work above.
