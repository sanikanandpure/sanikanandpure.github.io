YoungBytes is a non-profit organization that aims to democratize math and technology education globally. YoungBytes benefits students from 4+ countries and provides services including tutoring, coding bootcamps, 
online courses, and career planning. 
<br><br>I served as the Executive Director from 2021-2023. 
My time at YoungBytes was truly a transformative experience for me and tested my creativity, organizational and leadership skills. As director, I spent countless hours recruiting students and tutors, planning new programs, developing curriculum, and teaching programming and math.
By the time I graduated and passed on the directorship, YoungBytes had grown from a Texas-based organization to a multinational one that spanned several countries including the US, UK, Canada, and India.<br><br>
YoungBytes was also recognized as a high-impact nonprofit by the <b>Dallas Voyager's Canvas Rebel Magazine</b>.
